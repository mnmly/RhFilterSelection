## FilterSelection Command for Rhino

Simply filters the current selection based on the object types.

(It seems there is `SelectionFilter` in Windows, but can not be found for mac... [discussion]())


### Installation

Download `rhFilterSelection.rhp.macrhi` from [Releases](https://github.com/mnmly/RhFilterSelection/releases/tag/0.0.1), then double click to install.

### In action.

1. Select objects.
2. Type `FilterSelection`
3. Pick the object types you want to keep
4. Hit 'Done'
